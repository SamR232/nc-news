# Bug Fixing

This project requires you to havea minimum of version 14.17.3 of Node.

# Extra info

At the moment, the app has a hardcoded 'user'. This was done to allow me to build the app in the timeframe allocated by Northcoders. Given more time I would liked to have implemented a secure login feature, allowing a user to create a profile themselves.
